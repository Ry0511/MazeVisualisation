# App Framework
The application framework is the backend abstractions to OpenGL, GLFW, and stb_image.

# Development
Development was done using CLion and CMake complied and tested using MSVC C++20.

# Dependencies
The framework relies on OpenGL, GLFW3, GLM, and stb_image

## Library Usages
1. OpenGL    - Used for renderering
2. GLFW3     - Used to create and handle Windows
3. GLM       - Used for its Vector and Matrix mathematics
4. stb_image - Used to load images from disk
